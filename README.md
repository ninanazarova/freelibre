# freelibre

_v 0.1.0_

This is a blood sugar monitoring app for logging and searching treatments and meals. It serves as an alternative to FreeStyle Libre and similar apps.

There is a demo mode that shows the capabilities of the application with mocked data. It has inaccuracies with the graph data, namely, on the page of a certain treatment, the graph is generated randomly when the page is reloaded. This is done for simplicity or because of laziness ðŸ™‚ Anyway, you can get the idea of â€‹â€‹the application from this [demo ðŸš€.](https://freelibre.vercel.app)


### Features
A standout feature of freelibre is the ability to search food intakes and view related insulin doses and blood sugar levels before and after each meal. Think of it as a time-travel tool for specific moments. The app integrates with NightScout for data storage and retrieval.
- **Home screen:** Day overview with a blood sugar chart
- **Logging and search:** Record notes and search through them
- **Mobile-focused:** Optimized for mobile, but responsive on web
